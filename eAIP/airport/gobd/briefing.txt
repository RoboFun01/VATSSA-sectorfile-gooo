===== GOBD Pilot Briefing =====

//Pilots taking part in events that depart from or arrive to GOBD should make themselves familiar with this briefing page as well as with all existing charts.//

==== Overview ====

  * GOBD Dakar-Diass Blaise Diagne Intl Airport is Dakar's most recent international airport, capable of supporting a higher volume of traffic movements and aircraft types than the historical GOOY Leopold Sedar Senghor airport. It is a single runway (01/19) airport with RNAV and ILS (01 only) approaches and multiple airport parking positions.

  * All charts are public, and links to chose charts can be found on [[charts|this eAIP page]]. 

==== Departure Briefing ====

=== Clearance Delivery ===

  * GOBD does not have a real world Delivery position but one has been created on VATSIM, particularly for busy events. If offline, contact Ground for Delivery Clearance.

  * When requesting IFR clearance, please provide your Aircraft Type, Stand Number and ATIS letter.

=== Departure Procedures ===

  * GOBD has RNAV departures. Please inform controllers on first contact if you are unable to comply or follow one of the departures. Once a controller gives you a departure procedure to follow, please pay special attention to altitude and speed restrictions.

==== Arrival Briefing ====

=== Arrivals and Approaches ===

  * As your flight is approaching GOBD, you should make yourself familiar with the existing Arrivals (STARs), Holding Points and Approaches.

  * Be aware that GOBD has 3 distinct sets of ILS Approaches (X, Y and Z) and that they have distinct approach procedures. Controllers will inform you what Approach to expect based on an assigned Arrival.

  * **During CTP, please expect one of the LIGOV or PIVSA STARs.** 

  * **Please note, during CTP, a custom enroute hold at PIVSA may be activated. If activated, the inbound course will be 060ยบ, with right hand turns, and each leg will be 10 NM. Pleasure ensure you are familiar with how to fly such a custom hold.**
  * **A similar custom hold, around LIGOV might be utilized. If used, the inbound course will be 117ยบ, with right hand turns, and each leg will be 10 NM. Pleasure ensure you are familiar with how to fly such a custom hold.**

  * GOBD is a single runway airport, so during Arrival Events (like CTP), you should expect to Hold.

  * In case of a Missed Approach or a Go Around, climb to 3000 ft and maintain runway heading. You'll receive further instructions by the Controllers.

  * During busy events, expect to vacate right on C3 if landing 01 or vacate left on C5 if landing 19. You might be requested by Tower to continue taxi after vacating the runway. Follow the instructions.

=== Parking and Ground Operations ===

  * GOBD has plenty of parking positions across multiple aprons. Initial aircraft may be offered the Main Terminal Apron whilst subsequent aircraft will be directed to adjacent Aprons. There is limited parking availability at the Cargo Apron and due to its location on the airfield, you may be requested to taxi to a different parking position during busy events.
  * During extreamly busy events, we ask that pilots disconnect within a reasonable timeframe of getting to their stands, in order to ensure there is enough stands for all pilots.
