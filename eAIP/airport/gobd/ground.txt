==== Taxi In Procedures ====

  * In low traffic situations, Tower Controllers are expected to hand over arrival traffic to Ground Controllers once the traffic has vacated the runway. 

  * In high traffic situations, in order to maintain the high speed exits clear of traffic, Tower Controllers may issue an initial taxi instruction to arrival traffic before handover to Ground Controllers.

  * The table below show the instructions the Tower Controller can give, along with an instruction to contact the Ground Controller once vacated.

^ Rwy ^ Exit ^ Taxi Instructions ^ Remarks ^
| 01  | C3 (High Speed) | <code>Taxi Right on CHARLIE</code> | - |
| ::: | C2 | ::: | - |
| ::: | C1 | ::: | - |
| 19  | C5 (High Speed) | <code>Taxi Left on CHARLIE</code> | - |
| ::: | C6 | ::: | - |
| ::: | C8 | <code>Taxi Right on CHARLIE</code> | //Cargo Apron Only// |

  * The exception with this rule is traffic landing on runway 19 and wishing to vacate at the end to Apron V. In this situation, Tower Controllers will maintain control of the aircraft, and the aircraft should never be handed off to the Ground Controller.
